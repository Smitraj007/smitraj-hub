1. Data Ingestion
Types of Failures:

Type 1:

Applies to both Full Load and Delta Load.
Possible failures during pipeline execution, such as timeout, outage, or incorrect load selection.
Type 2:

Specific to Delta Load.
Issues with curated data or vectors caused by raw data, chunks, or Azure OpenAI-related issues.
Handling Failures:

Use the recovery job to restore the pipeline to the last successful state via a time-travel-based recovery approach.
2. RAG Model Serving
Types of Failures:

Type 1:

Missing or inappropriate rights for the service principal to access attributes defined in configuration YAML files.
Type 2:

Incorrect routing to the appropriate vector database and index table.
Type 3:

Configuration errors in YAML files, such as missing or incorrect parameters (e.g., model settings, database paths).
Type 4:

Service connectivity issues, such as network disruptions impacting communication with the vector database or external APIs.
Type 5:

Resource limitations, including insufficient compute capacity for vector operations or model inference.
Type 6:

Data unavailability, such as missing or incomplete vectors in the index table.
Type 7:

Timeout or latency issues during vector search or model inference.
Handling Failures:

Manual Debugging of Code: Primary solution to identify and resolve errors.
Re-running Jobs: Re-trigger the job after resolving the identified issue.
Preventive Actions:
Ensure proper configuration of YAML files and validate service principal permissions.
Monitor and resolve resource constraints and connectivity issues.
3. Monitoring
Types of Failures:

Type 1:

Misconfigured validation rules that classify valid data as invalid.
Type 2:

Missing values or incorrect schema in ingested data disrupting validations.
Type 3:

Mismatched schema versions causing failure in historical and current data distribution comparison (drift monitoring).
Type 4:

Missing reference datasets or skewed sampling resulting in undetected drift.
Type 5:

Incorrect log parsing logic leading to failure in metrics aggregation jobs.
Type 6:

Misconfigured thresholds preventing accurate SLA alerts generation.
Handling Failures:

Debugging Code: Analyze logs for error messages and investigate specific issues like the "cannot open socket" error.
Re-running Jobs: Resume failed jobs after resolving underlying problems.
Preventive Actions:
Implement robust error handling and improve logging mechanisms.
Monitor and maintain cluster performance metrics.
